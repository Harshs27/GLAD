This folder contains glad as a python module. Some variants of this code was used in the experiments for the ICLR paper.  
It also contains implementation of some other baselines that we compared against: ADMM, GISTA, Graphical Lasso (BCD)

# matrix squareroot
Thanks to the folks at pytorch discussion forum, I have updated the code to calculate the matrix square root and its backprop implementation. Replace the torch_sqrtm.py by torch_sqrtm_faster.py  

I have included both the versions as results in the paper were reported using the slower one.
